# Body of Knowledge - Desired Table of Contents

The IDPro BoK Table of Contents for Volumes 1 and 2 are aspirational documents. Their purpose is to list what material IDPro intends for the BoK and to put that list in context so that potential authors and readers can see where a topic falls and what material we expect an article to cover. If an article has already been published on a topic in the BoK, its abstract and a reference link are included in the body of the document. If not, notes on the desired content are included (this is a work in progress).

Readers may take this list of topics and consider it a self-study guide for what information to study to be considered proficient as an Identity and Access Management (IAM) practitioner. Volume 1 is intended to be topics foundational to the field of IAM, whereas Volume 2 is intended to cover more advanced and/or sector-specific areas.

Individuals interested in submitting content for the IDPro BoK are encouraged to review the information posted on its [Submissions](https://bok.idpro.org/submissions/) page.

If you have questions or feedback on the Table of Contents itself, please submit an issue in this repository. Pull requests are also welcome and will be reviewed by the IDPro BoK Committee.
