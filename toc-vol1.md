Introduction to Identity – Part 1: Admin-time *– published*
-----------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: This article introduces the concepts of digital identity and
identity and access management (IAM). It also discusses the constituents
that identity professionals serve, compares and contrasts
business-to-employee (B2E) and business-to-consumer (B2C) identity use
cases, and considers IAM technologies from the perspective of
administrative, or admin-time, technologies.

Introduction to Identity – Part 2: Run-time *– published*
---------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: Who are you, and what are you allowed to do? In digital
systems, these questions are the domain of “Identity and Access
Management (IAM).” Access management systems provide the mechanisms for
deciding who is who, and evaluate and enforce decisions about who should
get access to what. Part 2 of the introduction explores the big picture
of access management through a historical perspective. You can expect a
little advice, a lot of context, and an experience-based overview of
what we do in access management and why our contributions matter.

Background Fundamentals
-----------------------

Proposed Abstract: There are a variety of basic concepts that underly
how all computer systems function. Understanding those basics will help
an identity practitioner understand how technologies at the network
layer impact the architecture of an identity system and how to read
technical specifications. Topics in this section include:

-   DNS and DNSSEC

-   Security Vault

-   PKI

-   TCP/IP

-   HTTPS

-   TLS

-   [Digital Communications Protocols
    Comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/edit#gid=0)

Information Security
--------------------

### How to Develop an IAM Threat Model

Abstract: An article that explains the differences in threat models and
security postures involved in using different client types, including
explanations around common attacks on identity systems (credential
stuffing, phishing, password spraying).

Also, in this article or in an additional one, offer information on how
to protect against attackers with different capacities and methods of
account compromise and cover the importance of researching existing
threat models before finalizing an identity system architecture.

### Encryption Primer 

#### hashes and cryptographic hashes

#### symmetric and asymmetric cryptography

#### keys, key handling, and secret storage

### IAM Implications of PKI *- published*
Abstract: Public Key Infrastructure, or “PKI,” is a technology that enables authentication via asymmetric cryptography. It is widely deployed for some vital security use cases on the Internet, especially for authentication of servers via Transport Layer Security (TLS).
 
Despite its wide use for some scenarios, there are significant challenges in deploying PKI for more widespread use among smaller organizations or consumers.
 
Identity Professionals who need to deploy a PKI or have inherited a deployed PKI from someone else have several important considerations, including lifecycle management of keys and certificates, choosing the appropriate way to encode user identifiers and understanding cross-PKI trust.

Topics to cover: best practices around handling deceased persons’
digital ID

Digital Identity
================

Definition of Digital Identity
------------------------------

Abstract: Despite the difficulty of creating a universal definition of
identity, we create a working definition of a more limited concept of
digital identity.  In this section, we focus on human persons and touch
only slightly on non-personal identities such as corporations and
devices. Starting with the concept that digital identity is a unique
identifier together with relevant attributes required to enable the
identifier to be used in the context of a digital transaction, this
article elaborates and articulates interesting details, such as the
level of certainty about and provenance of attribute values.

### Reputation

Digital Identifiers *– published*
---------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: An identifier is the way an identity management system or other entity refers to a digital identity. The identifier used by the system, however, likely differs from the identifier used directly by the user and will definitely differ from identifiers in another domain. This article reviews the concept of identifiers as they relate primarily to people, both from a user’s perspective and a system’s perspective, and their impact on the systems that use them.

Glazer, I., (2020) “Identifiers and Usernames”, IDPro Body of Knowledge 1(1). doi: [https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.16](https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.16)

### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) *- published*

Abstract: As digital transformation sweeps across the globe, it has affected everyone – from citizens to employees, from corporations to governments. Digital identity is a foundational enabler for business processes in the digital economy. Decentralized identity is the next evolution of digital identity capabilities and brings with it an opportunity to streamline how people interact with other institutions, physical objects, and with one another. This paper considers the future world of decentralized identity and offers clarity around the benefits of decentralized identity, terminology, sample scenario, and a sample technical implementation, while also addressing some of the limitations of this model. This paper further grounds the reader in the current state of decentralized identity capabilities while outlining the evolution of identity practices from past to present.

Digital Identity Lifecycle *– published*
----------------------------------------

Abstract: A digital identity goes through several stages during its existence, from creation, through various modifications in response to different events, to inactivation or deletion. This article walks through the types of digital identities that must be managed, along with the various stages of a digital identity, describing the typical beginning-to-end lifecycle within or across multiple systems. The lifecycles outlined in this document are not meant to be comprehensive but should be applicable over most B2B, B2C, and B2E use cases.

Proofing, Binding or Registration 
---------------------------------

Abstract: In many contexts, it is important to relate a human to a
digital account.  Typically it matters in commercial and institutional
environments. This activity has been described as proofing or vetting,
implying certainty about the mapping. But there is a gradient of need -
in some cases, it is very important such as in the fields of medicine or
finance, whereas in other cases much less care is needed to achieve the
needed level of assurance. This article discusses the drivers and the
palette of tactics that can be used to balance the desired level of
certainty to the mapping and the desired level of friction to be
experienced by the user.

### Level of Assurance Model and mapping to risk

### Evidence and chain of custody

### Creation and delivery of credentials 

#### Self-sovereign credentials (including FIDO style)

### Verification/Validation

Credentials
-----------

Abstract: When the registration process contains more than a little
friction, many systems provide a way to avoid that friction during
logins, a process that happens many more times than registration does.
In the simplest scenario, this is done by issuing a user ID and a
password, in other words, a credential. This section describes the
varieties of credentials that are in common use.  It also describes
methods for establishing credentials (how to convey them safely) and
some recovery mechanisms when they are lost or compromised. Because
credentials can be stolen, this article touches on the approach that
some implementations have taken which look to device identities to
reduce risk.

Should include one or more articles describing the use of various
credentials and their tradeoffs. These article focuses on credentials,
but in some cases the credential and identifier are bundled. Each type
described includes benefits and limitations, and common places where you
might find the type.

1.  passwords, including notions of entropy/strength, hygiene and
    additional protections such as lock-out, and protection of central
    password stores using hashes and salts. Some user practices that
    increase risk, such as re-using passwords.

2.  certificates - how it works, FIDO as an implementation

3.  biometrics - varieties of methods; philosophy - is it an identifier
    and/or a credential?

4.  passwordless approaches which may use biometrics or certificates,
    one time use-URLs

5.  One Time Password schemes, TOTP, HOTP,

6.  Out of band schemes - One time code via eMail, SMS, "push",
    Discord's session projection scheme, bearer tokens - one time
    use-URLs

### Introduction to Verifiable Credentials

Access Control
==============

Introduction to Access Control *– published*
--------------------------------------------

Abstract: As the name implies Identity and Access Management (IAM) is
split into two functions: managing identity information and performing
access control. Arguably, if there was no access control requirement
there would be no need for identity management; it is therefore the
focus for IAM professionals.

At its core access control is ensuring users are authenticated to access
protected resources. This is accomplished by managing user entitlements
and satisfying the requirements of relying applications so that users
can only access the systems and information they are entitled to access. This article looks at the history of access management, the expected
current functionality and the trends to be expected.

### Dynamic Authentication (risk-based)

### Multi-Factor Authentication

### Single Sign-on Within a Domain

### Centralised Authentication Service

### Federated Authentication (between domains)

### Device Identity for Corroboration

### Fast Identity Online (FIDO) 

### Session Management

Dynamic Access Management / Policy Management solutions

### Policy-Based Access Control *- published*
Abstract: The natural evolution of access controls has caused many organizations to adopt access management paradigms that assign and revoke access based on structured and highly reproducible rules.    One such paradigm is known as Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), which is most differentiated by two key characteristics:  

1. Where other access control paradigms often optimize for ease of granting user access to all relevant resources, PBAC optimizes for ease of extending resource access to all applicable users.    
2. PBAC facilitates the evaluation of context (time of day, location, etc.) in granting access to a protected resource.  Context is used to express who may access a resource and the conditions under which that access is permissible.  

Shifting the focus of access controls from the user to the resource allows PBAC systems to be particularly resilient against shifts in organizational structure or regulatory obligations.  The inclusion of context (such as an authorized user’s location or device) allows for additional security controls to be expressed and extended within resource permissions themselves, ensuring that all facets of access control are contained and auditable within a single structure.  

Because PBAC accommodates a very precise expression of who may access a resource and under which circumstances, it lends itself to the automation of access provisioning and deprovisioning in a way that provides ease of management as well as increased security and adaptability.

### Privileged Access Management

#### Alignment to Risk Management

#### 

#### Entitlement vs Privilege

Introduction. Distinguish Entitlement and Privilege. What
entitlements/privileges are; method to protect confidentiality,
integrity and even availability of digital assets, and some physical
assets such as doors.

Also, using levels of risk to select permissions

1.  Static risks

2.  Dynamically determine risk at run time based on context

Additional controls to lower risk of HIGHLY privileged users, such as
session recording, credential checkout

### Impersonation

Topic - describes the use-cases where one person acting as another make
sense and what added controls may be desired.

### Delegation

Introduction to the concept of delegation in IAM systems

Laws, Regulations, and Standards
================================

Abstract: This chapter provides information about the externally defined
environment in which Identity and Access management professionals
operate.  The laws are documents that define duties and consequences in
legal jurisdictions, such as countries. Regulations are more specific
and detailed requirements.  Standards may also be mandatory; government
entities often require compliance with standards produced by certain
standards bodies. We also include de facto standards and recommended
practices here.

Framework to Understand Legal Environment *– published*
-------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: Identity systems and its participants are governed by a myriad
and complex set of laws, regulations, and contractual requirements, and
the obligations they impose are not always clear. This article focuses
on the legal environment that governs identity systems.  The emphasis is
on United States, but references are made to other countries’ laws and
efforts to coordinate rules underway in the UN Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) regarding identity management
legislation.

Smedinghoff, T. J., (2021) “Laws Governing Identity Systems (v2)”, IDPro Body of Knowledge 1(5). doi: [https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.8](https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.8)

Approach to Compliance for the Identity Practitioner
----------------------------------------------------

Abstract:

The overview, above, provides a broad perspective on what the
practitioner might encounter. This article provides a companion piece
that is less theoretical and more practical and concise. This does not
provide legal advice; for that one must consult a legal professional.
Instead we chart paths that the reader might take in sample situations
to prepare for legal review. The goal is to ensure the identity system,
as built and operated, will be in robust compliance with law. This takes
the form of three illustrative use-cases where the identity system
supports various combinations of jurisdictions, participants and
federation:

a\) Single jurisdiction, supporting customer access, including out-bound
federation for certain aspects of the customer journey;

b\) A system that relies entirely on external "identity providers", with
operations in several jurisdictions;

c\) A multi-jurisdiction employee/contractor-focused system, which
wishes to use biometric techniques for authentication.

The general approach is to use the jurisdictions, participants,
federations and technologies under consideration in order to locate
aspects of the law that must be considered.

Highlights of Selected Laws
---------------------------

Abstract: This section is organized by jurisdiction.  It is intended to
provide at a minimum a reference to known laws and regulations in
jurisdictions likely to be encountered by our membership.  At present
this includes Europe, United States, and Canada will likely also include
Australia in the short term.

### Europe

#### Introduction to GDPR – published

Abstract: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to any processing (including collection, storage, or sharing) of data relating to identifiable (including by serial numbers, IP addresses, etc.) individuals who are physically in Europe. This scope may well cover international or online Identity and Access Management (IAM) activities, as well as all IAM activities actually conducted in Europe. All such processing must conform to seven principles: lawfulness, fairness & transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity & confidentiality; accountability. Individuals have rights of information; subject access; rectification, erasure & restriction. Processing must be for one of six legal bases: contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public interests, legitimate interests, or consent. Each basis has its own requirements; some confer additional rights on individuals.

#### IAM Implications of GDPR – published

Abstract: This article examines the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”, “Regulation”) on Identity and Access Management (“IAM”) process and system design. It introduces organisational and technical good practices that may help ensure demonstrable compliance with the Regulation as well as improve user experience and customer trust.

Although the focus here is on the GDPR, the approaches described may, by extension, also help in complying with data protection legislation in other geographies including (for example) the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), or the Brazilian General Data Protection Law (“LGPD”).

### Provisioning (On-boarding and Off-boarding) *- published*
User provisioning is the means by which user accounts are created and maintained in a system (e.g., database, SaaS app, operating system, etc.). When we say that a user-provisioning system maintains a user account, we mean everything from changes to attributes in the user account, changes of entitlements or privileges associated with the user account, locking and unlocking the user account, and even deletion of the user account. User provisioning is primarily an admin-time affair: a user account is created (or changed) based on an administrative action as opposed to a user’s action at the time of resource use. This article explores the uses and components of a user-provisioning system and focuses mainly on situations where user accounts are maintained in central repositories, typically enterprise and workforce settings.

Consumer/Citizen IAM
====================

Key Characteristics of CIAM
---------------------------

CIAM vs Workforce IAM
---------------------

This introductory article reviews the main key differences between IAM
in the consumer world versus IAM in the enterprise. Some of these
differences include: focusing on the consumer experience and consumer
needs as opposed to the needs of the enterprise and offering a different
balance between what a consumer expects in terms of usability and
security versus enterprise requirements.

Consumer Journey
----------------

Consumers are the focus of the CIAM program. There are several areas
that need to be considered that could help you implement a successful
CIAM program, including the registration process for consumers,
determining and implementing assurance requirements, and the handling of
user consent. This section focuses on these areas, offering specific
examples and guidance for the IAM practitioner in the consumer-focused
industry.

### Registration of consumers

This article discusses consumer registration in a product or service.
Registration is one of the early experiences in your product. Too much
friction in this step would result in consumers going away. In general,
it's the idea of asking for as little as possible on first contact
(email-only or email+password registration) and then using various
profile enrichment strategies later on, e.g., MFA, shipping address,
phone number, etc.

### Authentication assurance (meeting LoA requirements)

Most activities in CIAM do not require a great level of assurance to be
able to do an operation, for example, updating a birthday or a display
name. This article explores the concept of levels of assurance (LoA) as
it applies to CIAM, including a review of activities that might require
a high authentication level of assurance as those are sensitive
activities such as the purchase of regulated goods, or access to
health-related records. In this case, another authentication process
might be rolled out, e.g., prompt another layer of authentication to
make sure the consumer is the right people perform the activities. 

### Data usage consent

The consumer should know how his/her data is being used by the company
to give a better experience to the consumer. That’s why it’s important
to ask the consumer's consent to make sure they are all aware of their
data usage and store the consent to help with a dispute in case it
happens. This article references "Managing Consent" by Eve Maler and
Graham Williamson, currently in the BoK queue and focuses on additional
considerations specific to CIAM.

### Social sign-in and sign-up

Social sign-up offers a consumer a way to sign-up to a CIAM system that
takes advantage of existing accounts owned by the user. CIAM-focused
companies can effectively outsource some of the user support (such as
password management) to these social media systems and instead focus on
what information is required for personalization. This article explores
how social media logins can complement a CIAM infrastructure and offers
suggestions on how to offer the maximum benefit to the consumer. This
article ties closely to the Data Usage Content article.

Unified consumer view
---------------------

This article describes the opportunities and challenges involved with
supporting a unified view of the consumers of a product or service to a
company in order to support targeted marketing, content, or product
recommendations. In order to have a unified consumer view, the CIAM
system could provide flexible attributes so the application is able to
add its own unique fields and help shape the consumer profile. Done
appropriately, this service can be of value to both the company and the
consumer.

Privacy and Compliance *- published*
----------------------

Abstract: This article is the first of several sections of the IDPro Body of Knowledge that address Privacy and Compliance for Consumers. This introductory section sets the foundation for subsequent sections on privacy within the IDPro Body of Knowledge, providing an overview of a variety of topics, including definitions of privacy, different approaches to privacy in the consumer sector versus the workforce environment, and more.

Security
--------

Good security must underpin all CIAM initiatives as this is the key to
protect consumer data and to maintain their trust in our system. It is
important to remember user experience should be considered as well while
creating a good security model. The following sections explain some key
methods for achieving good security.

### Adaptive authentication

It is an authentication action that takes account of other
dynamic-runtime environment data or context-based attributes, e.g.,
device location, time to login, etc., in addition to credentials such as
username and password to authenticate users. The authentication is also
known as risk-based or contextual authentication.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

This refers to the use of more than one credential in the authentication
of the user. Generally, the use of multiple factors results in a higher
LoA for the user's authentication. Two-factor (2FA) is the simplest
example of MFA where two different credentials are used. MFA provides a
variety of factors to choose from, ranging from asking a security
question to capturing and confirming biometric data to using physical
authentication keys, codes or One-Time Passwords (OTPs) over SMS/email
or Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) (Google Authenticator). 

Non-Human Entity 
================

Introduction - *published*
--------------------------
Abstract: Non-human accounts are often the “Achilles’ heel” of a robust IAM environment. While IAM professionals concern themselves with managing identities, authentication, RBAC, ABAC, governance, and auditing of user accounts, other IT staff are deploying devices and services that are given access to protected resources via hard-wired accounts, exposed services, and APIs. 
The management of non-human account control should be consistent with user-based account management, and controls placed on user account access to high-assurance applications should also be applied to non-human accounts. 
There is no single solution for dealing with non-human accounts. Some IAM professionals suggest all accounts should be managed via the same processes and same infrastructure to ensure consistent policy deployment. This consistency, they argue, should ensure that non-human accounts are not ‘left-out’ when IAM deployments occur. Others consider this impractical and recommend that purpose-specific processes be deployed for non-human accounts. But regardless of the mechanism(s) used to manage non-human accounts, ensuring that they are managed is paramount. Otherwise, non-human accounts will continue to be a cybersecurity attack vector favored by hackers for gaining access to corporate facilities.

IAM Architecture and Solutions 
==============================

IAM Architecture Overview *– published*
---------------------------------------
Abstract: Abstract: In this section of the BoK, you will explore several conceptual architectures and how they enable IAM solutions across your enterprise. IAM touches all aspects of an organization’s IT environment whether it’s the HR system, email system, phone system or corporate applications, they all need to interface to the IAM environment. Whether it is by supporting the enforcement of user provisioning rules or validating the access of non-corporate users, IAM will always play a role in making IT operations efficient and secure. An architectural approach will heighten the probability that a consistent and comprehensive IAM solution will be achieved.

### IAM Reference Architecture - *published*
Abstract: This article provides a reference model to organize the presentation of technical details associated with various implementations of identity and access management (IAM) architectural concepts. The model is conceptual, as are the set of abstract components which it provides.

To move out of the conceptual realm into specifics additional articles follow, each with a focus on a specific technical use-cases. Each such use-case indicates which of the abstract components comprise a particular implementation

Dobbs, G. B., (2021) “IAM Reference Architecture”, IDPro Body of Knowledge 1(6). doi: [https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.76](https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.76)


### Technical Use Cases

The articles in this section describe a single use-case as implemented
in a particular architecture to illustrate a set of components and how
they are connected and interact to perform the use-case. These articles
are group by the functions defined in the FIRST article (things like
authentication, provisioning, authorization...)

The use-case articles follow a common structure:

-   Use-case name

-   Architecture Type or types (The styles are described in
    "Introduction to IAM Architecture," IDPro Body of Knowledge"
    article: Host, Client-Server, N-tier, Hub & Spoke, Remote Access,
    Cloud Environments. )

-   Short description

-   Actors, components, and connectors included (with a diagram). The
    components and connectors refer to the abstract architectural
    components and their implementations in this use-case.

-   Prerequisites

-   Exposition on how the components work together and some level of
    detail. In general this describes the external viewpoint. Internals
    of the component are minimized.

-   Where to find more information on this and adjacent use-cases

Example: of a use-case. This example is chosen to indicate how
constrained these articles are intended to be. There could be quite a
few variations on Windows login.

Designing MFA Services *- published*
------------------------------------
Abstract: This article describes how to deploy a thoughtful, consumer-friendly multi-factor authentication (MFA) program that will allow the IAM practitioner to successfully deliver on both the security and usability needs of their authentication systems. The approach is based on a framework of six pillars: determining the viability of different forms of MFA, allowing a multimodal rollout of MFA options, encouraging adoption, supporting MFA across all services and access channels, designing support processes, and creating a trusted environment where MFA can offer additional security to both the consumer and the company.

Operational Considerations
==========================
Introduction *- published*
--------------------------
Abstract: This article will establish recommendations for best practices when managing the identities of your end-users in a customer service environment, considering the risks of both external and malicious insider threats. The following recommendations are built from the authors’ experiences and observations, and the recommendations included should be considered a starting point to inspire discussion. More rigorous study is necessary to further refine guidelines for this subject.

Account recovery *- published*
----------------
Abstract: Abstract: All systems that require authentication of users share a common problem: users are human.  Users forget or lose their credentials, lose, reimage, break, or sell hardware with embedded credentials (e.g., a phone or laptop).  Account access is lost when users lose access to an email address their account is bound to.  In some systems, credentials expire and need to be reissued.  The common theme is that users need alternative mechanisms to restore access to the accounts whose credentials are unavailable.
 
The following article establishes a framework for evaluating Account Recovery mechanisms and establishes recommendations for Account Recovery in consumer, education, enterprise, and government spaces by identifying the benefits and risks of common mechanisms.  Given the variety of concerns – privacy, security, and access continuity - in different domains, the reader of this document is expected to apply the guidance herein alongside their domain expertise and judgment to design, develop, and deploy Account Recovery mechanisms for their online systems.  Due to the intersection between Account Recovery actions and Customer Service teams, the author strongly recommends that the reader also consult the article “Managing Identity in Customer Service Operations” in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.

Project Management
==================

Many Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects proceed without a
project manager. In these cases the IT group in charge of identity
management are left to deploy the required solution in the absence of
any overarching management. While this is sometimes seen as the most
expedient way to get a system installed or updated, it is short-sighted
and likely to cost the organisation more money in the longer term. An
IAM solution touches so many systems within an organisation and is
dependent on the current and planned condition of so many applications
that to deploy a solution without properly considering the impact,
managing the required resources and keeping management advised of
progress, will result in a substandard deployment.

Here we look at two ways to manage a project – “Classic”, sometimes
called Waterfall, and “Agile, a way to manage projects that accommodates
changes that inevitably arise during the course of a project.

Reference is made to the Project Management Institute (PMI) Framework.
This document in no way seeks to replicate the PMI’s methodology or
replace the project management training that the PMI provides. The
reader is referred to the PMI Body of Knowledge for further information.
