\chapter{Laws, Regulations, and
Standards}\label{laws-regulations-and-standards}}

Abstract: This chapter provides information about the externally defined
environment in which Identity and Access management professionals
operate.~ The laws are documents that define duties and consequences in
legal jurisdictions, such as countries. Regulations are more specific
and detailed requirements.~ Standards may also be mandatory; government
entities often require compliance with standards produced by certain
standards bodies. We also include \emph{de facto} standards and
recommended practices here.

\hypertarget{framework-to-understand-legal-environment}{%
\section{Framework to Understand Legal
Environment}\label{framework-to-understand-legal-environment}}

Abstract: Identity systems and its participants are governed by a myriad
and complex set of laws, regulations, and contractual requirements, and
the obligations they impose are not always clear. This article focuses
on the legal environment that governs identity systems.~ The emphasis is
on United States, but references are made to other countries' laws and
efforts to coordinate rules underway in the UN Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) regarding identity management
legislation.

\hypertarget{approach-to-compliance-for-the-identity-practitioner}{%
\section{Approach to Compliance for the Identity
Practitioner}\label{approach-to-compliance-for-the-identity-practitioner}}

Abstract:

The overview, above, provides a broad perspective on what the
practitioner might encounter. This article provides a companion piece
that is less theoretical and more practical and concise. This does not
provide legal advice; for that one must consult a legal professional.
Instead we chart paths that the reader might take in sample situations
to prepare for legal review. The goal is to ensure the identity system,
as built and operated, will be in robust compliance with law. This takes
the form of three illustrative use-cases where the identity system
supports various combinations of jurisdictions, participants and
federation:

a) Single jurisdiction, supporting customer access, including out-bound
federation for certain aspects of the customer journey;

b) A system that relies entirely on external "identity providers", with
operations in several jurisdictions;

c) A multi-jurisdiction employee/contractor-focused system, which wishes
to use biometric techniques for authentication.

The general approach is to use the jurisdictions, participants,
federations and technologies under consideration in order to locate
aspects of the law that must be considered.

\section{Highlights of Selected
Laws}\label{highlights-of-selected-laws}}

Abstract: This section is organized by jurisdiction.~ It is intended to
provide at a minimum a reference to known laws and regulations in
jurisdictions likely to be encountered by our membership.~ At present
this includes Europe, United States, and Canada will likely also include
Australia in the short term.

Abstract: There are many standards. Standards may be mandatory such as
when government entities require compliance with standards produced by
certain standards bodies.~ We also include \emph{de facto} standards and

been deemed to be useful to identity professionals.~ They are organized
topically, not by their source. Standards that span more than one topic
are possible. In this case cross references may be used.

Many Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects proceed without a
project manager. In these cases the IT group in charge of identity
management are left to deploy the required solution in the absence of
any overarching management. While this is sometimes seen as the most
expedient way to get a system installed or updated, it is short-sighted
and likely to cost the organisation more money in the longer term. An
IAM solution touches so many systems within an organisation and is
dependent on the current and planned condition of so many applications
that to deploy a solution without properly considering the impact,
managing the required resources and keeping management advised of
progress, will result in a substandard deployment.

Here we look at two ways to manage a project -- ``Classic'', sometimes
called Waterfall, and ``Agile, a way to manage projects that
accommodates changes that inevitably arise during the course of a
project.

Reference is made to the Project Management Institute (PMI) Framework.
This document in no way seeks to replicate the PMI's methodology or
replace the project management training that the PMI provides. The
reader is referred to the PMI Body of Knowledge for further information.
