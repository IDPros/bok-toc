Laws, Regulations, and Standards
================================

Abstract: This chapter provides information about the externally defined
environment in which Identity and Access management professionals
operate.  The laws are documents that define duties and consequences in
legal jurisdictions, such as countries. Regulations are more specific
and detailed requirements.  Standards may also be mandatory; government
entities often require compliance with standards produced by certain
standards bodies. We also include *de facto* standards and recommended
practices here.

Framework to Understand Legal Environment
-----------------------------------------

Abstract: Identity systems and its participants are governed by a myriad
and complex set of laws, regulations, and contractual requirements, and
the obligations they impose are not always clear. This article focuses
on the legal environment that governs identity systems.  The emphasis is
on United States, but references are made to other countries' laws and
efforts to coordinate rules underway in the UN Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) regarding identity management
legislation.

Highlights of Selected Laws
---------------------------

Abstract: This section is organized by jurisdiction.  It is intended to
provide at a minimum a reference to known laws and regulations in
jurisdictions likely to be encountered by our membership.  At present
this includes Europe, United States, and Canada will likely also include
Australia in the short term.

supports the requirements of prominent regulations.

Standards
---------

Abstract: There are many standards. Standards may be mandatory such as
when government entities require compliance with standards produced by
certain standards bodies.  We also include *de facto* standards and
recommended practices here. This is a curated set of standards that have
been deemed to be useful to identity professionals.  They are organized
topically, not by their source. Standards that span more than one topic
are possible. In this case cross references may be used.

Project Management
==================

Many Identity and Access Management (IAM) projects proceed without a
project manager. In these cases the IT group in charge of identity
management are left to deploy the required solution in the absence of
any overarching management. While this is sometimes seen as the most
expedient way to get a system installed or updated, it is short-sighted
and likely to cost the organisation more money in the longer term. An
IAM solution touches so many systems within an organisation and is
dependent on the current and planned condition of so many applications
that to deploy a solution without properly considering the impact,
managing the required resources and keeping management advised of
progress, will result in a substandard deployment.

Here we look at two ways to manage a project -- "Classic", sometimes
called Waterfall, and "Agile, a way to manage projects that accommodates
changes that inevitably arise during the course of a project.

Reference is made to the Project Management Institute (PMI) Framework.
This document in no way seeks to replicate the PMI's methodology or
replace the project management training that the PMI provides. The
reader is referred to the PMI Body of Knowledge for further information.
